My enthusiasm continued post-recovery, leading me to commit fully to this new career path. After seven months of self-directed learning, I looked for a more structured approach and enrolled in a bootcamp. This experience, combined with my strong work ethic and desire to exceed expectations, significantly enhanced my technical skills. Now I am eager to apply my knowledge in a professional environment and continue growing in the dynamic field of technology.",
