It encompasses the implementation and practical application of fundamental data structures including Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Hash Maps, and Hash Sets, along with a Binary Tree. Additionally, the project delves into algorithmic techniques, featuring implementations of Binary Search and Bubble Sort. Each component was created to deepen my understanding of computer science principles, showcasing my ability to both grasp and apply complex concepts in a real-world context.",

This collection features classic games such as Black Jack, Higher-Lower, Rock Paper Scissors, Hangman, and more, each designed to provide a fun and engaging way to interact with the fundamentals of coding.\n\nAmong these projects is my first attempt at solving the Knight's Tour puzzle, tackled just two weeks into learning programming. This endeavor, although not optimized for efficiency, represents a significant milestone in my coding journey, showcasing my early enthusiasm and willingness to tackle complex problems head-on. While it remains a work in progress, it symbolizes the beginning of my deep dive into the world of algorithms and data structures, setting the foundation for my continuous learning and development in software engineering.",
