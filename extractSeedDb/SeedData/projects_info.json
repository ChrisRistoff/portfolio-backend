Tests for this one are also done inside containers and using compose for the test database container.\n\nThe site will allow for staff management, expenses and profit management, projects will be added to the main site once marked as completed, I plan for invoice generation and sending it as a pdf to a given email.\n\nAs of right now I'm still mostly planning and building the basic features of the main site.",
